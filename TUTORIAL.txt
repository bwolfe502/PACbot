PACBOT - HOW TO USE
====================

This guide explains how to use every feature in PACbot.


BLUESTACKS SETUP (DO THIS FIRST)
---------------------------------

PACbot will NOT work unless you change two settings in BlueStacks:

  1. Open BlueStacks Settings (gear icon)
  2. Go to "Advanced" or "Device"
  3. Set Resolution to: 1080 x 1920
  4. Go to "Advanced"
  5. Turn ON "Android Debug Bridge (ADB)"
  6. Click "Save" and restart BlueStacks if prompted

The resolution must be exactly 1080x1920 or PACbot won't be able
to find buttons and UI elements on screen. ADB must be on or
PACbot won't be able to connect to the emulator at all.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

1. Open BlueStacks and wait for it to fully load
2. Open your game inside BlueStacks
3. Double-click run.bat to start PACbot
4. PACbot will open a window with your emulator listed under "Devices"

If no devices show up:
  - Click "Auto-Connect" to detect emulators
  - Click "Refresh" to update the device list
  - Make sure BlueStacks is running before starting PACbot
  - Make sure ADB is turned ON in BlueStacks settings


DEVICES
-------

The Devices section shows all connected emulators. Each device has a
checkbox next to it. Only checked devices will be affected when you
start a task. If you have multiple emulator instances running, you can
select which ones to control.


AUTO QUEST
----------

Turns on automatic quest completion. PACbot will:
  - Check your available troops
  - Open the quest screen and claim any rewards
  - Detect quest types (Evil Guard and Titan currently supported)
  - Automatically complete the quest by starting a rally
  - Repeat on a loop until you turn it off

IMPORTANT: Auto Quest only works during Battle League (BL) weeks.
During rest week, BL is not available and Auto Quest won't have
quests to complete. During rest week, use the Individual Actions
menu instead — expand it and use "Rally Titan" or "Rally Evil
Guard" to farm manually or on a repeating timer.

To use:
  1. Make sure your game is on the map screen
  2. Click "Auto Quest: OFF" to turn it on (it turns green)
  3. Click it again to stop

Note: Auto Quest, Auto Occupy, and Auto Pass Battle are mutually
exclusive. Turning one on will stop the others.


AUTO OCCUPY (Territory)
-----------------------

Automatically attacks and occupies territory squares. PACbot will
scan the territory grid, find enemy squares, and send troops to
capture them.

Before using:
  1. Go to Settings and set "My Team" to your team color
  2. Set "Attack" to the enemy team color you want to target
  3. Click "Set" to save

To use:
  1. Click "Auto Occupy: OFF" to turn it on
  2. PACbot will continuously scan and attack enemy territory


AUTO PASS BATTLE
----------------

Automates pass/tower battles. This is the most complex auto mode.

Setup:
  1. In your game, place a Personal "Enemy" marker on the pass or
     tower you want to target
  2. In PACbot Settings, choose your Pass Battle Mode:
     - "Rally Joiner" - joins existing war rallies when the enemy
       holds the pass
     - "Rally Starter" - starts new rallies when the enemy holds
       the pass
  3. Set the Pass Battle Interval (in seconds) - how long to wait
     between reinforcement checks (default: 30s)

To use:
  1. Click "Auto Pass Battle: OFF" to turn it on
  2. PACbot will:
     - Navigate to your target marker
     - If you own the pass: reinforce it, then wait the interval
     - If the enemy owns it: join/start war rallies continuously
  3. Click it again to stop

IMPORTANT: You MUST set a Personal "Enemy" marker on the target
first. If PACbot can't find it, you'll get a warning popup.


SETTINGS
--------

Auto Heal
  When enabled, PACbot will automatically heal your troops before
  any action that requires troops. Enabled by default.

Pass Battle Mode
  - Rally Joiner: joins existing rallies (good for support accounts)
  - Rally Starter: starts new rallies (good for main accounts)

Pass Battle Interval
  How many seconds to wait between reinforcement checks during
  Auto Pass Battle. Default is 30 seconds.

Min Troops
  Set the minimum number of troops that must be available before
  PACbot will send them. If your available troops are at or below
  this number, PACbot will skip the action and wait.
  Type a number and click "Set".

My Team / Attack
  Used for Territory mode. Set your team color and the enemy team
  color you want to attack. Click "Set" to apply.

Territory Square Manager
  Opens a visual grid of the territory map. You can manually select
  which squares to attack or ignore. Useful for focusing on specific
  areas or avoiding squares you don't want to touch.


INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS
------------------

Click "Individual Actions" to expand a panel with three tabs:
Farm, War, and Debug. These let you run tasks manually.

Each task row has:
  - A checkbox: check it to run the task on a repeating loop
  - An interval box: how many seconds between each repeat
  - A button: click to run the task once

FARM TAB:

  Rally Titan
    Searches for a Titan on the map and starts a rally against it.

    rally sequence (5 dark priests + final boss).

  Join Titan Rally
    Opens the war rally list and joins an available Titan rally
    started by an alliance member.

  Join Evil Guard Rally
    Opens the war rally list and joins an available Evil Guard
    rally started by an alliance member.

  Heal All
    Heals all wounded troops.

WAR TAB:

  Target
    Opens the target menu, selects the Enemy tab, and navigates
    to your marked target. You must have a Personal "Enemy" marker
    placed in your game.

  Attack

    troops first and heals if Auto Heal is on.

    90 seconds looking for a valid spot.

DEBUG TAB:

STOP ALL
--------

The dark "STOP ALL" bar at the bottom stops every running task
on every device immediately.


TIPS
----

- Always start BlueStacks and load your game BEFORE starting PACbot
- Make sure the game is on the map screen before starting auto tasks
- Set your Min Troops if you want to keep a reserve
- Use Auto Heal to avoid sending injured troops
- For pass battles, always set your target marker FIRST
- If something seems stuck, hit STOP ALL and try again
- Check the console/terminal window for detailed logs of what
  PACbot is doing
