PACBOT (WINDOWS + BLUESTACKS ONLY)

This program only works on:

Windows 10/11

BlueStacks (Windows version)

It will NOT work on Mac.

REQUIREMENTS

BlueStacks installed and running

Python 3.11 or newer installed

A valid license key (message Nine on Discord to get one)

STEP 1 - SET UP BLUESTACKS

Before PACbot will work, you MUST change two settings in BlueStacks:

  1. Open BlueStacks Settings (gear icon)
  2. Go to "Advanced" or "Device"
  3. Set Resolution to: 1080 x 1920
  4. Go to "Advanced"
  5. Turn ON "Android Debug Bridge (ADB)"
  6. Click "Save" and restart BlueStacks if prompted

PACbot will NOT work without these settings.


STEP 2 - INSTALL PYTHON

Download and install Python from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Any version 3.11 or newer will work (3.12, 3.13, 3.14, etc).

IMPORTANT:
During installation, make sure you check BOTH of these:

  [x] Add python.exe to PATH

  [x] Install launcher (py.exe)

STEP 3 - RUN PACBOT

Unzip/extract this folder anywhere (example: Desktop)

Double-click: run.bat

The first time you run it, it will automatically:

  - create a local Python environment
  - install required packages
  - check for updates
  - ask for your license key
  - start the program

NOTES

Start BlueStacks BEFORE running PACbot

If PACbot shows no devices, click Auto-Connect or Refresh in PACbot

TROUBLESHOOTING

If run.bat closes instantly:

  Python is not installed correctly.
  Reinstall Python and make sure you check:
    - Add python.exe to PATH
    - Install launcher (py.exe)

If you get "No devices found":

  Make sure BlueStacks is fully loaded before starting PACbot.
  Click Auto-Connect, then Refresh.
